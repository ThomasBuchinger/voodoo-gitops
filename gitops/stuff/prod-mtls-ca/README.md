# mTLS Details

This repository only contains the private key. The Certificate for the Root-CA is generated by cert-manager (if `spec.secretName` exists and contains a Key, it is reused). You can re-generate the Key using this command:

```shell
openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -noout -out buc-root-ca-mtls.key
```

Device Certificates are signed directly by the Root-CA

(Maybe) To allow temporary access from unknown devices, a intermediary CA could be used to issue Certificates with only 24h lifetime
